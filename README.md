# Analysis of Persian and English tweets related to Maryam Mirzakhani's death
Before and after the passing of Prof Maryam Mirzakhani, the Field Medalist who died of breast cancer at age 40, I observed different reactions in English- and Persian-speaking social media. For instance, the reactions seemed more sentimental and political in Persian posts, and they also started with rumors about her cancer before her passing in those posts. I used tweepy to collect every tweet that had her last name in both languages starting 5 days before her passing. This repository shows the results of the analysis of that data.
